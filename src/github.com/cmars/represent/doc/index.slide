* Introducing represent

The Go language developers created [[http://talks.golang.org/2012/go-docs.slide#21][Present]], a tool for authoring clean and simple HTML5 slide decks. Presentations are authored in a text-based format similar to wiki markup.

Present is designed to serve presentations from an embedded HTTP server with live sandboxed code demonstrations.

Represent is my adaptation for rendering static HTML pages.

* Installation

1. [[http://golang.org/doc/install][Install the Go language tools]].

2. Set up your $GOPATH. Add $GOPATH/bin to your $PATH.

3. Download and install.

  $ go get github.com/cmars/represent
  $ go install github.com/cmars/represent

* Usage

Write some .slide and .article files in the [[http://godoc.org/code.google.com/p/go.talks/pkg/present][Present format]].

  $ represent

compiles all the Present files in the current working directory into a hierarchy of static html pages. Compiled HTML and linked assets will be written into a `publish` subdirectory.

  $ represent -src <source> -publish <publish>

compiles a directory tree of Present files located in _source_ to the _publish_ directory.

This presentation was compiled with represent. Mmm dogfood!

* TODO

Feature ideas:

- Themes. Can definitely be overdone. Don't want all decks looking the same though.

- Extensions to the Present markup. Sub-headings in slides, tables.

- Weblog Features. Timeline of posts, index, tags, etc.

Pull requests welcome.
